## Introduction

Welcome to "Create Your Own Chatbot Website with Open Source LLMs" project! In this project, you'll learn how to create a simple chatbot using open-source Language Model Libraries (LLMs) with Python and Hugging Face. By the end of this lab, you will understand the main components of a chatbot, how transformers and LLMs work together, and how to integrate your chatbot into a web interface.

### How does a chatbot work?

A chatbot is a computer program that takes a text input and returns a corresponding text output. It utilizes a special kind of computer program called a transformer, which acts as its brain. Inside this brain lies a language model (LLM) that helps the chatbot understand and generate human-like responses by analyzing patterns from a large dataset of text.

The process of interaction between the user and the chatbot involves:

1. Input Processing: The transformer breaks down the user's input into smaller parts called tokens, making it understandable for the chatbot.
2. Understanding Context: These tokens are then passed to the LLM, which interprets the context of the message based on its training on extensive text data.
3. Generating Response: Using its understanding, the LLM generates a response, which is then formatted and sent back to the user by the transformer.
4. Iterative Conversation: This process repeats as the conversation progresses, with the chatbot continually processing new inputs and generating relevant responses.

### Hugging Face

Hugging Face is an organization specializing in natural language processing (NLP) and AI, offering a variety of tools and resources to support NLP tasks. We'll be utilizing their Python library transformers for this project.

## Project Outcomes

By the end of this project, we will:
- Understand the main components of a chatbot.
- Learn about transformers and LLMs.
- Gain insights into how to choose an LLM for our application.
- Understand the working of a transformer and tokenization.
- Be able to program oour own simple chatbot in Python.
- Integrate our chatbot into a web interface.
- Communicate with the backend using a webpage.

## How to Run This Project?

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Save the provided code in a Python file (e.g., app.py).
2. Run the Python file by typing `python app.py` in the terminal.
3. By default, Flask hosts the server at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
4. Access the server by visiting `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` or `http://localhost:5000/` in your web browser.

If running in the Skills Network Cloud:

1. Navigate to the Skills Network Toolbox from the toolbar on the left side of the IDE.
2. Click on ‚ÄúLaunch Application‚Äù in the adjacent vertical sidebar.
3. Put `5000` as your Application Port.
4. Launch the application in a new browser tab.
